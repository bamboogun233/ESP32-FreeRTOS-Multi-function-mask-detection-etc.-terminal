# ESP32-FreeRTOS-Multi-function-mask-detection-etc.-terminal
This is a multifunctional terminal based on esp32 and FreeRTOS. You can use it to enjoy Hutao shake. There are also many functions, including mask detection, face recognition and real-time human-computer interaction. In order to achieve the above functions, you may need to use it with k210.
This project is based on the vscode editor. You can import this project through the platformio plug-in. Incidentally, the project uses the esp32 Arduino framework, which already contains FreeRTOS header files.
